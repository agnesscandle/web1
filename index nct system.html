    </p>The SM Entertainment introduced a new male idol named <strong>NCT</strong>.
    NCT means Neo Culture Technology, and they are composed of three main groups : <strong>NCT127, NCT DREAM, WayV</strong>.
    <p>This formation is very typical idol group like others. But, they have special traits compared others.
    Because The SM Entertainment has adapted <u>an union system</u> and <u>unlimited expansion system</u>, especially.
    For example, if there is a song they decide to release, they consist specific members who are likely to fit well.
    Plus, if trainees finish training period and are ready to become singers, they can be added as a new member of NCT.</p>
    <p>The system is quite difficult to understand because all idol group has been fixed.
    This is because I want to make the website to introduce and explain what NCT is adn how the NCT system are composed and members can be added.</p>
